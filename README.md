note: when I made the index.html I pathed the wrong way to the "Week_x" folder, I didn't capitalize the "W". So when entering the link via just https://nordin11.github.io/DataProcessing-Homework/ you get pathed to the "week_x" folder which doesn't exist because the "W" isn't capitalized. 
I did try to commit changes in my pathing but it doesn't seem to work? So for now I just manually changed the "w" to "W" myself.
