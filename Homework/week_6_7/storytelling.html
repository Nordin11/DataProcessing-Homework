			<h1> Description </h1>
			<p> With the scatterplot I want to give visitors a look at the wealth inequality in  the world. At the same time I want to initiate a correlation between the amount of GDP and the happiness in a country that I suspect. Furthermore I choose for a white container with shadows and a maxwidth for the scatterplot, so that it really standed out. With the map I wanted people to really visualize where the country really is on the world map. This can be important so that the visitors gets an extra stimulant to think about it, for example when he sees that indeed a lot of this low and high GDP's are grouped together. </p>

			<h1> Story </h1>
			<p> What more can I say? Everybody knows wealth isn't equally shared. This is absolutely known. But what really wondered me was the happiness of the people. Do the people in countries with a really low GDP feel less happy? I suggested that this should be true. The poor living standard can make people unhappy. But where is the inequality really situated? In the world map one can see where this countries are situated. When you look for a while, you can state that most of the wealth comes from the western society and are all grouped together, while poor countries don't get a chance to hitch on. 
			<br>
			The question is: When will the western society wake up and do something about this?
			this is easy to say, cause the side that can so something about it, are at the same time the once that don't feel a thing from this equallity.
